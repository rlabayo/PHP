# PHP

Saving up some of PHP exercises that I answered:
  
  1. one.php
    
    - Write a function to see if a number is contained within a sorted array.
      * Do not use in_array() and other PHP built-in Array functions.
    
  2. two.php
    
    - Randomize an array. Implement the following function with the following constraints:
      * Do not use existing solutions such as shuffle() or array_rand()
      * You may use rand()
      
      * Shuffle the elements in an array
      * @param array $input An array to be randomized 
      * @return array The randomized array
      
   3. three.php
   
    - Remove Duplicates Using a Hash (Associative Array). Implement the following function with the following constraints:
      * You may use only 1 loop (nested loops are not allowed)
      * Do not use any PHP built-in array searching functions
      * Sample Array to remove duplicate [‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘apple’, ‘mango’, ‘banana’]
      
      * Remove duplicate values from an array
      * @param array Array of values that may be duplicated
      * @return array An array that does not contain duplicates  
      
   4. four.php
   
    - Write a single regular expression that can be used to match all of these date formats: mm/dd/yyyy, m/d/yyyy, mm/d/yyyy, m/dd/yyyy
